# 🎬 Cineasternas Filmklubb – A Movie Site with Ratings, Reviews & Followers

**Cineasternas Filmklubb** is a web-based application built as a school project by two students at Mid Sweden University in autumn 2024. This was our first project working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and API integrations.

The site allows users to:
- Search for movies using the OMDb API
- View detailed information about each movie
- Submit their own ratings and reviews to a custom CMDB backend
- Explore top-rated movies, follow other users, and interact through a star rating system
